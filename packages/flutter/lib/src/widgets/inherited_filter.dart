/// class MyLabel extends InheritedFilter<LabelSelector> {
///   const InheritedFilter({

  /// [InheritedFilter] subclasses override this method so that dependents
  /// are notified when there's a change to the output of any of their [Selector]s.
  ///
  /// {@tool snippet}
  /// Often, the [selector] is a [Function], and [select] simply returns its output.
  /// Example:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// typedef LabelSelector = String Function(Map<String, dynamic> json);
  ///
  /// class MyLabel extends InheritedFilter<LabelSelector> {
  ///   const InheritedFilter({
  ///     super.key,
  ///     required this.json,
  ///     required super.child,
  ///   });
  ///
  ///   final Map<String, dynamic> json;
  ///
  ///   static String of(BuildContext context, LabelSelector selector) {
  ///     final MyLabel label = context.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType<MyLabel>(aspect: selector)!;
  ///     return label.select(selector);
  ///   }
  ///
  ///   @override
  ///   String select(LabelSelector selector) => selector(json);
  /// }
  /// ```

  ///
  /// There are a few ways for the [InheritedFilter.select] method to engender
  /// useful equality checks, so dependents are notified to rebuild only when
  /// there's a relevant change:
  ///
  ///  1. Return a `const` value, such as [Brightness.dark],
  ///     [MouseCursor.defer], or `const SawTooth(3)`.
  ///  2. Return an object that supports stable equality checks, e.g.
  ///     an instance of [num], [EdgeInsets], [TextStyle], or [BoxDecoration].
  ///     A custom class declaration can be set up the same way, by overriding
  ///     the [Object.operator==] and [Object.hashCode] fields. Alternatively,
  ///     [Record] types support stable equality without additional setup.
  ///  3. Override the [EqualityFilter.equality] getter to define a custom
  ///     relationship, such as [MapEquality] or [CaseInsensitiveEquality].
  ///     This can be done with the [InheritedFilter] class, or alternatively,
  ///     any selector object that implements the [EqualityFilter] interface
  ///     can individually customize the [Equality] relationship for its results.
  //
  // TODO(nate-thegrate): example app!

  /// Compares the result of [select] with the previous result to determine
  /// whether the dependent should rebuild.

  /// Whether the [InheritedFilterElement] should begin the work of notifying
  /// dependents when its widget is rebuilt. If the result is `false`,

  /// has a large number of dependents.
